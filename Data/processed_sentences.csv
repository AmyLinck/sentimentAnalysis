6823,Check out our latest paper 
6824, I never said that...you asked about the Potts study that is what they did.  I coach all my athletes with appropriate methods...
6825, “...the double knee bend technique is an inherent characteristic of the skill and need not necessarily be taught” Potts
6826, 1)cognitive group= explicit coaching instruction 2) ecological group = implicit instruction - not explicit items.
6827, 2 groups 1) Ecological and 2)Cognitive learning. Ecological group (self exploration) =+519 w in 2nd pull
6828, Potts concluded in his thesis - that you don't need to teach dbl knee bend as it happens naturally with a good progression
6829, I know of no studies comparing the watts between those taught DBL Knee bend and those who are not.  I can only hypothesise
6830,Really Like this paper “The molecular basis for load-induced skeletal muscle” hypertrophy. -
6831, No - one used a specific teaching method for the double knee bend- the other did not. I was PhD assessor for this study.
6832, I have never done a study on the double knee bend
6833, If it doesnt then teach it.
6834, - Of course I want them to use it.  If you use an appropriate teaching progression for the lift - it happens.
6835, I agree double knee bend is essential nothing new Enoka showed this in the 80s....
6836," I don't teach it, unless the athlete doesn't get it naturally"
6837, you don't need to teach it as with a sound teaching progression it happens - Potts study
6838, you will see a reduction in power (watts) if you don't use a double knee bend...no exact number to give very individualised

7004, scientific evidence supports the 2xbwt as a delineated point where things shift
7005, I don't use the term absolute.  It's maximum and peak strength
7006," Nothing is ever absolute, but the science supports the strength and power relationship."
7007, Absolutely. He was saying people who squat >2xbwt have greater potential to develop power and can express power more effectively
7008, Power can be expressed at any load.  People who have higher force generating capacity have a greater capacity to develop power
